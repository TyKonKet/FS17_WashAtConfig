Many times you bring your vehicle to the shop to give it a new look, but after some changes, a repainting and a cost of work of 1000$, it's still dirt.  
If you agree with me that this is plenty tedious and unrealistic this is the right mod for you!  
With this mod, in the working cost is included a wash for your vehicle.
